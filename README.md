Airline ticketing system database

## Project summary
This project was designed with ideas taken from airline ticketing systems. It is designed to help passengers conveniently search and book tickets on many flights and quickly access the information they need. This database consists of 6 dimension tables and 2 transaction tables. The dimension table has passenger, flight, airline, aircraft, seat, and airport tables, and the transaction table has booking and payment tables. The airline database is a database that can be commonly used in actual business settings, and it is believed that through this exercise, you will be able to experience a closer experience to the field.
